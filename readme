CIL floor toilet indicator (Raspberry pee)

INSTALLATION
This scripts has a few dependencies. To install those, run this:

# bash bin/install_dependencies.sh

once that is done, start the indicator with 

$ bin/rpee-indicator.py

CONFIGURATION
The notifier has a default configuration that typically works, but should you wish to change anything, create a file called ~/.rpee with the following content:

[rpee]
server_url=http://136.225.5.101/toiletdata.php
sleep_time=3
resource_dir=/var/tmp/rpee/icons
http_timeout=10


These settings can then be modified. This should normally not be needed.
